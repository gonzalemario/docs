title: Connecting to your database
---

We package and support a number of components to connect to your EDB Postgres Advanced Server database server. These EDB components are based on PostgreSQL components and typically support additional EDB Postgres Advanced Server capabilities. EDB Postgres Advanced Server also works with the community versions of these components. 

The EDB components for connecting to your database include:
