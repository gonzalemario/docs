title: Connecting to your database
---

We package and support a number of components to connect to your EDB Postgres Advanced Server database server. The components support both EDB Postgres Advanced Server and PostgreSQL. These EDB components are based on PostgreSQL components and typically support additional EDB Postgres Advanced Server capabilities. 

The EDB components for connecting to your database include:

- Connectors
  - [EDB JDBC Connector](/jdbc_connector/latest/) &mdash; provides connectivity between a Java application and a Postgres database server. 

  - [EDB .NET Connector](/net_connector/latest/) &mdash; provides connectivity between a .NET client application and a Postgres database server

  - [EDB OCL Connector](/jdbc_connector/latest/) &mdash; provides an API similar to the Oracle Call Interface that you can use to interact with a Postgres database server.

  - [EDB ODBC Connector](/odbc_connector/latest/) &mdash; allows an ODBC-compliant client application to connect to a Postgres database server
