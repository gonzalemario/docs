title: EDB Components
---

We package and support a number of Postgres components to use with EDB Postgres Advanced Server. The EDB components support the advanced features of EDB Postgres Advanced Server (needs PM review). EDB Postgres Advanced Server also works with the community versions of these components.

The EDB components include:

- EDB PostGIS (links to the docs)
- EDB Connectors_Test
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
- EDB Foreign Data Wrappers
  -
  -
  -
EDB PgBouncer
EDB PgPool

The documentation for each EDB component provides information on:
- Installing the component including which platforms it is available on (see the Installing topic)
- Which version of the component is supported on which version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server (let's make sure this information has been implemented with a common URL so that we can say - see xxx topic)
