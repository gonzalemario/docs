title: EDB components

We package and support a number of Postgres components to use with EDB Postgres Advanced Server. These components typically support additional EDB Postgres Advanced Server capabilities. Many of these are enhanced versions of open source components.  EDB Postgres Advanced Server also works with the community versions of these components.
