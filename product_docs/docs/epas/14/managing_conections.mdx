title: Managing your database connections
---

We maintain a number of open source components to manage your connections to your EDB Postgres Advanced Server database server. The components support both EDB Postgres Advanced Server and PostgreSQL. These EDB components typically support additional EDB Postgres Advanced Server capabilities. 

The EDB components for managing your database connections include:


- Connection poolers
  - [EDB PgBouncer](/pgbouncer/latest/) &mdash; a lightweight connection pooling utility for Postgres installations

  - [EDB Pgpool-II](/pgpool/latest/) &mdash; acts as middleware between client applications and a Postgres database server
