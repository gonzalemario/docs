title: Managing your database connections
---

We package and support a number of components to manage your connections to your EDB Postgres Advanced Server database server. These EDB components are based on PostgreSQL components and typically support additional EDB Postgres Advanced Server capabilities. 

The EDB components for managing your database connections include:


- Connection poolers
  - [EDB PgBouncer](/pgbouncer/latest/) &mdash; a lightweight connection pooling utility for Postgres installations

  - [EDB Pgpool-II](/pgpool/latest/) &mdash; acts as middleware between client applications and a Postgres database server
