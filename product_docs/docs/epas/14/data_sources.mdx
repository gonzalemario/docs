title: Connecting to external data sources
---

We maintain a number of open source components to use to connect your Postgres database server to external data sources.  The components support both EDB Postgres Advanced Server and PostgreSQL. These EDB components typically support additional EDB Postgres Advanced Server capabilities. 

The EDB components include:

  - [EDB Hadoop Foreign Data Wrapper](/jdbc_connector/latest/installing/) &mdash;  accesses data that resides on a Hadoop file system from a Postgres database server

  - [MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper](/mongo_data_adapter/latest/) &mdash;  accesses data that resides on a MongoDB database from a Postgres database server

  - [MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper](/mysql_data_adapter/latest/) &mdash;  accesses data that resides on a MySQL database from a Postgres database server
